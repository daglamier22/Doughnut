Basic Idea
----------
Can't Stop the Doughnut Shop will be an Asteroids style game with doughnut shop treats instead of asteroids being thrown towards the player.



Story Line
----------
N/A



Visual Design
-------------
Can't Stop the Doughnut Shop will contain simple 3D objects with a cartoonish look and feel.

Screen Layout:
	Can't Stop the Doughnut Shop takes place in a fixed space the size of the screen with the current score and high score displayed in the top right corner of the screen.



Audio Design
------------
Can't Stop the Doughnut Shop will contain whimsical background music to set a light hearted mood.

Sound effects will occur when:
	The player activates the thrusters
	The player fires the cannon
	The player collides with an object
	An object is broken apart by cannon fire
	An object is destroyed by cannon fire

Occasionally some objects will have special movement sounds for added affect.

Sound Effects and Music will have independant volume/mute control.



Control
-------
User interaction is limited to the mouse:
	Cursor Movement
	Left Click: Fire Cannon
	Right Click: Activate Thrusters



Interaction
-----------
The player's ship can:
	Activate Thrusters
	Fire Cannon
	Collide with Objects

Doughnut shop treats will come in a variety of styles, some with unique behaviors:
	Various styles of donuts that act like basic asteroids and break into smaller peices before being destroyed
	Pigs-in-a-blanket that act like the enemies in Space Invaders and travel in packs
	Coffee that moves quick but is worth extra points
